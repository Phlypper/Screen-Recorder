Screen-Recorder

This is an app that is designed to record videos running in other tabs on your browser.
Once the app is running, you can open another tab and play a video of your choice and go back to the app and press start recording. Once the video is over, press stop recording and the app will allow you to download the recording in .webm format. 

Below are instructions on how to set up and run the application locally.
